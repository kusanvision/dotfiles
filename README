This project contains some dotfiles like .vimrc and .bashrc
for my ArchLinux setup on my netbook. The goal is to make
backups of the dotfiles and also to make myself familiar
to git version control system.

Update: installed Pop OS! 22.04 a few days ago.

Updated .bashrc after setting up my yubikey
